# HeinCMS

## What it is

HeinCMS is my selfwritten php cms. It has plugin support and theme support is coming soon.

## Where can I get it?

It's [right here on GitHub](https://github.com/marchein/cms).

## I have a problem or idea!

Great!  [Create an issue](https://github.com/marchein/cms/issues), or, better yet, fork the project and contribute!
